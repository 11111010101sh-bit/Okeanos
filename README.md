# Okeanos – Gamifying Ocean Literacy
Overview:
Okeanos is a gamified web-based prototype developed during the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) to promote ocean literacy and marine conservation awareness. The project focuses on making learning about oceans engaging through interactive gameplay, visual storytelling, and immersive experiences that align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and INCOIS.

The prototype was developed as part of a 36-hour national hackathon, where our team was selected as finalists for the innovation and relevance of the solution.

Problem Statement:
Lack of awareness about ocean ecosystems, marine biodiversity, and sustainable practices contributes to environmental degradation. Traditional learning methods often fail to engage users effectively.

This project aims to address the gap by using gamification and interactive technologies to improve understanding and engagement in ocean literacy, developed for all age groups.

Proposed Solution:
- A gamified digital platform with multiple levels focused on ocean-related themes, incorporating INCOIS elements.
- Interactive learning through quests, challenges, and visual exploration
- Use of immersive visuals to make abstract environmental concepts more accessible

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- 3D Graphics & Visualization: Three.js  
- Game & Prototype Exploration: Godot (basic exposure)  
- Design & Styling: CSS-based layouts and UI components  

Key Features:
- Multi-level interactive gameplay
- 2D visual elements to simulate ocean environments
- User interaction through navigation, challenges, and exploration
- Educational content integrated into gameplay mechanics

Hackathon Experience:
- Developed during Smart India Hackathon (SIH), a national-level competition  
- Participated in a 36-hour continuous hackathon held in Hyderabad  
- Collaborated closely as a team under strict time constraints  
- Selected as finalists, demonstrating teamwork, resilience, and innovation  

Learnings & Takeaways:
- Importance of teamwork and task prioritization in time-bound environments  
- Hands-on experience with rapid prototyping and collaborative development  
- Improved problem-solving skills and ability to adapt under pressure  

Future Scope:
- Expand gameplay with additional levels and narratives  
- Integrate real-world ocean data for enhanced learning  
- Improve visual realism and user interaction  
- Explore AR/VR-based ocean exploration experiences
